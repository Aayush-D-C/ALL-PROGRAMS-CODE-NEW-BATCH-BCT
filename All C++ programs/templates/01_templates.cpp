//Templates in C++
/* As we start building our application we start repeating ourselves either we
willingly want or we dont want, similar is the case for class and objects 
when a specific datatype is needed to be passed in functions or class 
e.g. we want to divide among 2 numbers then we will write a seprate for
the int type and another for the float type but there is a easy way to tackle
that and here comes the templates.

int main() {
    // Write C++ code here
